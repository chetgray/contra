  <p>This is not a working file. This is my plan for going forward.</p>

  <p>figure.js holds a new abstract client-side representation of figures. Incorporate it into the figure editor and perhaps the figure viewer. </p>
  <p>Transition the DB to use the new format writing a horrible migration.</p>
  <p>The new figure editor will be like this</p>

  <pre>[figure____] [param] [param] [beats]</pre>
  <p>Parameters are pushed in as needed as called for by each figure's specifics</p>
  <p>Also, there are <i>formation transitions</i>, which take by default 0 beats, to change to short lines down the hall (or whatever) </p>
  <p>Also also, there are progressions, where the frame of reference changes from one neighbor to another.</p>
  <p>Also also also, there are partner-progressions, where the frame of reference changes from one partner to a shadow.</p>
