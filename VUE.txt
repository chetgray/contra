PLAN FOR VUE

- keep asset pipeline as-is for now
- install webpack 4
- host es6 import/export libfigure in webpack land
- write a import/export stripping compiler script that writes the same source
  files out to asset pipeline
- (optional) see if there's a way to auto-run the script every time a
  source file changes
