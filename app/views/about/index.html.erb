      <h1>What is ContraDB?</h1>

      <p>Callers: have you ever forgotten your calling cards? Ever needed to
        make a last-second change to your program of dances? Ever figured
        out a way to improve a widely-called dance, but haven't had a way to
        share it widely?</p>

      <p>With ContraDB you can store your contra dances in the cloud, access
        them from a browser, arrange multiple dances into
        programs, analyze your creations, remix others'
        creations, and search dances by title, choreographer, or figure.</p>  

      <p>If you have written dances, or have permission to redistribute
        others' dances, please publish them on ContraDB. The larger the
        database is, the more useful a resource it becomes. </p>

      <p>ContraDB makes it easier for you to convene great contra dances.</p>
