== MODEL ==

A user has-many dances, has an pkID, and a bunch of other stuff.

A choreographer has-many dances, and has a pkID. Choreographer #1 is
"unknown".

A dance has one user ID, one title, one choreographer ID, one start-type
(improper, beckett, beckett-reverse, proper, or indecent), up to 8
figures (encoded as strings), and some notes (text). It should
probably primary key on (user, title), but that'd take work, so it'll
just have a pkID. 

Users may copy another user's dance (a "fork"). 
Dances may only be edited by the controlling user; however,
choreographers are global and are largely immutable except by user 0,
who can rename and delete them. There might be locking issues with
this, but they don't seem too heinous.
