A user has-many dances, and has an ID.
A choreographer has-many dances, and has an ID.
A dance has one user ID, one choreographer ID, one start-type
(improper, beckett, beckett-reverse, proper, or indecent), up to 8
figures (encoded as strings), and some notes (text).

Users may copy another user's dance (a "fork"). 
Dances may only be edited by the controlling user; however,
choreographers are global and are largely immutable except by user 0,
who can rename and delete them.
